If you look at his ECG there is the presence of widespread ST depression and T-wave inversion with the presence of U waves. A pseudo presence of a long QTc due to the fusion of the T and U waves. This is a classic representation of Hypokalaemia. </p> <p>Hypokalaemia</p> <p>Severe hypokalaemia can lead to paralysis, particularly in extreme cases where potassium levels are critically low. This paralysis may affect respiratory muscles, leading to respiratory failure. Severe hypokalaemia can also result in muscle cramps, supra/ventricular arrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis, and myoglobinuria. Rhabdomyolysis results from muscle fibers breaking down and releasing their contents into the bloodstream, leading to kidney damage and potentially life-threatening complications.

For instance, propranolol can cause significant sodium channel blockade, akin to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), while sotalol is known for its potassium channel blockade, which can result in a prolonged QT interval and a heightened risk of Torsades de Pointes (TdP).</p>"},{"location":"Toxicology/Beta-blocker/#mechanism","title":"Mechanism","text":"<p>Beta-blockers function by competitively binding to beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors located in various systems, including the cardiovascular system, lungs, eyes, and liver. By binding to these receptors, beta-blockers reduce the production of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which diminishes the effects of catecholamines (such as adrenaline and noradrenaline). This reduction in cAMP leads to decreased heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac contractility, and blood sugar levels.</p> <p>In cases of overdose, beta-blockers can cause cardiovascular shock. This may force the cardiovascular system to rely more on glucose rather than fatty acids, which can result in decreased ATP production. Propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, can also cause sodium channel blockade, while sotalol, another non-selective beta-blocker, additionally inhibits potassium channels. This can lead to a prolonged QT interval and an increased risk of TdP.</p> <p>Beta-2 receptor blockade in the liver impairs glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and lipolysis. While these effects are generally minimal under normal use, they can cause significant hypoglycaemia in diabetic patients, particularly in paediatric populations. During an overdose, hypoglycaemia can be profound.</p> <p>Additionally, beta-2 receptor blockade in the peripheral vasculature and bronchial smooth muscle reduces the effects of catecholamines on smooth muscle contraction. This leads to peripheral vasodilation and can increase bronchial smooth muscle constriction, complicating the management of asthma and other related disorders due to reduced responsiveness to beta-2 agonists.</p>"},{"location":"Toxicology/Beta-blocker/#toxicokinetics","title":"Toxicokinetics","text":"<p>Beta-blockers are generally rapidly absorbed, reaching peak serum concentrations within 1-3 hours. Propranolol is highly lipophilic, meaning it is extensively distributed into fatty tissues and crosses the blood-brain barrier easily. In cases of overdose, the high lipophilicity of propranolol can lead to prolonged retention and extended elimination half-life. Additionally, because propranolol crosses the blood-brain barrier, it has significant central nervous system (CNS) effects, which is particularly important in cases of propranolol toxicity.</p> <p>Beta-blockers like Propranolol are highly protein bound. For example, Propranolol is 90-95% protein bound. The high protein binding of beta-blockers has significant implications for drug toxicity. Since a large portion of the drug is bound to plasma proteins, only the free (unbound) drug is pharmacologically active and able to cross cell membranes. In cases of overdose, the proportion of free drug can increase if the protein binding sites are saturated or displaced by other substances. This can lead to higher concentrations of the free drug in the bloodstream and tissues, including the central nervous system. As a result, the risk of toxicity may be heightened, with potentially severe adverse effects. Moreover, in conditions that affect protein levels or function, such as liver or kidney disease, the drug's distribution and elimination can be altered, further complicating the management of overdose and toxicity</p>"},{"location":"Toxicology/Beta-blocker/#clinical-presentation","title":"Clinical presentation","text":"<ul> <li>cardiovascular effects<ul> <li>hypotension due to a combination of myocardial depression and bradycardia</li> <li>sinus bradycardia (most common arrhythmia)</li> <li>first- to third-degree heart block, junctional bradycardia; ventricular bradycardia and asystole in severe poisoning</li> <li>QRS widening\u00a0in propranolol poisoning</li> <li>QT-interval prolongation\u00a0in sotalol poisoning</li> </ul> </li> <li>central nervous system effects \u2192 seizures, delirium and coma if poisoning is due to a lipophilic beta blocker (eg propranolol)</li> <li>respiratory effects \u2192 bronchospasm and pulmonary oedema, especially in patients with airway disease</li> <li>metabolic effects \u2192 hypoglycaemia (uncommon) or hyperglycaemia.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Toxicology/Beta-blocker/#video","title":"Video","text":""},{"location":"Toxicology/Beta-blocker/#propranolol","title":"Propranolol","text":"<p>Class II antiarrhythmic.
