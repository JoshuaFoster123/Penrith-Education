# General Contribution information


Contribution to the website is open to anyone. Information provided should be referenced, well researched and unopinionated. All information shared on the website is a best effort to be up to date and with current best practices in mind. 

As a general rule, all articles posted should include pathophysiology/pharmacology, clinical presentation, pre-hospital management, clinical PEARLS. All work should be referenced with up to date information. 

The idea behind this website is to create a collaborative hub of information. Often finding information about a particular pathophysiology/presentation is time consuming. The aim of this website is to research and collate information for ease of access. 

All levels of experience are welcome to contribute. The more people who contribute the better education everyone receives. 

All articles are written in markdown, which you can find a guide for [Here](/Guides/Markdown guide) although if you have written something in another word processor, feel free to submit that also. 

submissions can be submitted to: [Submit interest :fontawesome-solid-paper-plane:](mailto:submissions@penrith.education){ .md-button }
