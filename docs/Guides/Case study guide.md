# Case study contributors guide

Contributing case studies can provide great value to others as it often outlines challenges and solutions to a problem, contain rare or interesting diagnoses, learning and tips for others. 

Case studies are a great opportunity to share triumphs and defeats. Often those presenting case studies will do so anonymously, as to avoid prejudice, or judgement. Those submitting case studies can choose to remain anonymous although author recognition is encouraged.

Case studies need to pertain to a certain standard, to ensure high quality content and to protect the privacy of the patients involved. ^^**Privacy is not a maybe, it is a must.**^^

The purpose of case studies is to explore further a particular management or presentation which you would like to know more about. Sharing this information is beneficial to everyone.
Encouragement is given to those who are writing a case study to reference their information.

Below is a general guide to what can/should be included in a case study - following this guide will ensure your case study has all pertinent information. An outcome is not necessarily obtainable. 

I will iterate again that privacy is a must and any case studies with identifying information will not be posted. 

Case studies need to be written in markdown a guide can be found in the [Markdown Guide](/Guides/Markdown guide)
