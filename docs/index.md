# **Welcome**

Welcome to the unofficial Penrith education site. This site is intended for paramedics to write articles pertaining to *Pre-hospital* care and to share researched and referenced information collated into one place. 

The plan for the site is to eventually have a collection of information from paramedics in the pre-hospital space. This includes articles written by other paramedics, uploads of recorded face-face education and a collection of references to quality educational content. 

Case studies can be submitted for posting, and a separate guide for case study submissions will be available soon. A general contribution guide can be located below.

Encouragement is given to anyone who wants to contribute, regardless of experience.
